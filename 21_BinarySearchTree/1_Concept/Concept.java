/*
    BST -> Binary Search Tree
    1. left elements < root
    2. right elements > root
    3. all nodes follows BST(1 and 2)

    4. Inorder Traversal of BST will give sorted sequence of elements.

    -> It makes search efficient.

    -> Time complexity of BST -- O(H) where H is height of BST.

    -> Most problems will be solved using recursion i.e. by dividing
        into subproblems & making recursive calls on subtrees.
