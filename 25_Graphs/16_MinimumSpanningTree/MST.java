    MINIMUM SPANNING TREE (MST)
        A minimum spanning tree (MST or minimum weight spanning tree is a
        subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph 
        that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with 
        the minimum possible total edge weight.
        - no cycle
        - all vertices should connect
        - minimum weight to connect all
